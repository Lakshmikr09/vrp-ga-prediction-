# vrp-ga-prediction-
This repository presents an advanced machine learning pipeline for predicting the outcomes of Genetic Algorithm (GA) runs applied to Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). The approach is designed to save computational resources by forecasting GA performance early, without the need to complete full evolutionary runs.
